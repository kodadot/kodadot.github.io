Users are also able to add a new nominator using the `+ Nominator` button.
On the first image below the user selects account for the stash, account for the controller, funds to nominate, and reward destination.
If the stash account is protected by a password, the user has to also type a password.

> User is able to choose the same account for stash and controller, however, it's not recommended.

Clicking on the green `Generate` button, function `author_rotateKeys` is called, which generates session keys for the user.
