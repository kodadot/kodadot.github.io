## 🏗 Development

Contribution are welcome!

We are using `yarn` workspace, as installing things via npm **will result in broken dependencies.**

### 👷‍♀️ Get Started

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:vue-polkadot/apps.git <optional local path>`
2. Ensure that you have a recent LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), we are using in time of writing version `v12.16.0`
3. Recent version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install), we are now using `1.22.4`
4. Install the dependencies by running `yarn`
5. Now you can launch the UI. You can have local running [Substrate node](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/start-a-private-network-with-substrate) or connect to existing networks
6. Access the UI at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## 🐳 Docker
If you want just to try out our KodaDot on Kusama and have full local setup with local node, we assume you have docker and docker-compose installed

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```

If you want to run just KodaDot
```
docker-compose up kodadot
```

Build docker image of KodaDot
```
docker build -t hello/kodadot .
```

Run it locally and then visit `localhost:8080`
```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --rm --name hellokodadot hello/kodadot
```
